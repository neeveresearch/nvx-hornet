 * Provider interface for locating a Topic Oriented Application's 'managed' objects. 
 * <p>
 * A 'managed' object is one that is of interest to the Rumi server or TopicOrientedApplication
 * for introspection (e.g @{@link EventHandler} or @{@link AppCommandHandler} annotated
 * methods.)
 * <p>
 * It legal (though potentially inefficient) for a {@link ManagedObjectLocator} to return
 * objects that end up not being of interest to the application. 
 * <p>
 * A {@link ManagedObjectLocator} <i>may</i> return itself as a managed object in which case
 * the {@link ManagedObjectLocator} itself will be eligible to serve as an event or command
 * handler for the application. This may be useful, for example if the locator assumes responsibility
 * for cleaning up any objects it constructs.
