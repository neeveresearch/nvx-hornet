/**
 * Interface for sending messages in a Topic Oriented Applications. 
 * <p>
 * In topic oriented applications, service definitions bind message types
 * to {@link MessageChannel} that encapsulate the topics on which 
 * messages are transported by default. 
 * <p>
 * The {@link MessageSender}
 * interface provides methods that lookup up the channel associated with a given
 * message type as defined by the application's service definitions. Additionally
 * it provides sendMessage variants allowing the caller to override the topic
 * and provide a customized key resolution table for resolving dynamic portions
 * of the channel key.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b>
 * A {@link MessageSender} may be backed by one and only one {@link TopicOrientedApplication}
 * and is tied to that application's lifecycle and transaction context. Applications
 * that send outbound messages via a {@link MessageSender} as the result of processing
 * an inbound message must have received the message from the same {@link AepEngine} that
 * backs the {@link MessageSender}'s {@link TopicOrientedApplication}, failure to do so
 * would break the atomicity guarantees of inbound/outbound message and can in 
 * certain situations lead to deadlocks. 
 * <p>
 * <b>Threading</b>
 * Implementations of this class are not thread safe. Send calls may only be
 * called from an {@link EventHandler} that originates from the {@link AepEngine} that backs
 * the {@link TopicOrientedApplication} from whence this MessageSender came, or in a non concurrent 
 * fashion by an unsolicited 'sender' thread if this is a purely producer application.
